# Express API Template

To facilitate mine and your creation of projects using Express, I made this dependency template.

The template includes the following dependencies:
- Express
- Typescript
- Eslint (Single Quotes, Airbnb)
- Prettier

How to use the template:

#### `Use this repository as a template for your new repository`
#### `npm install`
#### `npm run dev`

To change the main file, from "server.ts" to "index.ts", for example, just renew the command in package.json, and rename the file.

- src/server.ts -> src/index.ts
